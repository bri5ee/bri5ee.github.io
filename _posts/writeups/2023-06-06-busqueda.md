Busqueda was an Easy Linux machine featuring a vulnerable version of a web application, following with an enjoyable privilege escalation journey. Initial access led to credential exposure of our user. We used this to expose a script we could run as `sudo`, which consisted of light code review and eventually path hijacking to obtain `root`.

```

## Initial Access
Before I could even do a verbose scan (`nmap -sCV ...`), I visited the website at `searcher.htb` since the IP auto-redirected to the domain which I put into my `/etc/hosts`.

Although I initially messed around with the features of the site which essentially allowed you to select a search engine and make searches through it, what caught my eye was that it was running on Flask and a specific web application called Searchor. They had also kindly provided the version number. With this information I was able to search for `Searchor exploit github`, where I landed on this [POC Python exploit](https://github.com/nikn0laty/Exploit-for-Searchor-2.4.0-Arbitrary-CMD-Injection). Surely enough, the version applicability lined up and I ran the exploit in order to receive a reverse shell: 

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot5.png)

## VHost Discovery
I landed in `/var/www/app` which is where the website was being hosted. Looking more closely, I found a `.git`
directory. In the `config` file, I found some creds, as well as the virtual host `gitea.searcher.htb`.

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot4.png)

I added `gitea.searcher.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` in order to access the site being hosted there. At the site, I'm greeted with `gitea`, a self-hosted Git server. I was able to successfully login as `cody` here:

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot6.png)

I wasn't able to find anything significant, and I was pretty confident that the files in the `.git` directory were synced with the site, therefore I decided to pivot and look around more.

Although the password I found in the git config file is for a user named `cody`, password reuse is common and is also present in boxes. Therefore, when I find a password, I like to try them with all the users I have. Since one of the things on my privilege escalation checklist is to check for forbidden and permitted commands for my user with `sudo -l`, I tried authenticating with `cody`'s password':

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot7.png)

Despite the password corresponding with user `cody`, I was able to successfully authenticate as user `svc` with the discovered password. 

## Docker Script
With the output of `sudo -l`, I discovered that I was able to run `/usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py *`.
Running the script as `sudo` showed the following:

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot2.png)

I try messing with all the options, and I notice that `full-checkup` returns `something went wrong` no matter the input. I leave it for the moment while I look at the other options.

After doing some research, I discovered that `docker-inspect` was likely in reference to the actual `docker inspect` command, which returns a set of specified information on a container. The option `docker-inspect` expected a specified `format` as well as a `container_name`. While the names of the 2 existing containers could be found by running `docker-ps`, the list of `formats` required looking at `docker`'s documentation for the command. To confirm that these were the `formats` that the script was expecting, I tested a format that would return the IP address of the container:

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot8.png)

Success :) So with the `docker-inspect` option, I could obtain information on the container... but what information could I even extract? I wasn't too familiar with the formatting, so I searched up some examples. One of the prominent examples I found was a format that specified environment variables:

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot9.png)

Boom, creds B) Not just one password, but two ![[Pasted image 20230705202226.png]]

I attempted logging into the `gitea` panel as `administrator`, as it was the only other user on the `gitea` panel besides `cody`: 

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot10.png)

Hey look, a `scripts` repository, the same name as the directory where `system-checkup.py` is located. Looking at the directory, I find the source code to the scripts.

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/screenshot11.png)

Darn, a rookie error! When the option `full-checkup` is passed, `system-checkup.py` calls the script by relative path. Unfortunately, well, fortunately for me, when relative paths are used, the system searches it's `PATH` variable first, and then the local directory. Since the script is running as `root`, it will call `full-checkup.sh` as `root`.

```python
...

    elif action == 'full-checkup':
        try:
            arg_list = ['./full-checkup.sh']
            print(run_command(arg_list))
            print('[+] Done!')
        except:
            print('Something went wrong')
            exit(1)
...
```

Essentially, I can run anything I want as root by:
1. creating my own `full-checkup.sh` script
2. exporting a new `PATH` location that contains my `full-checkup.sh` payload
3. running `system-checkup.py` and using the `full-checkup` option that will call my payload script rather than the local `.full-checkup.sh` script
